I have come to the realization that I am spending entirely too much time on Twitter. I really love Twitter, and that's probably the best explanation for it.

My problem with Twitter usually manifests as an easy way to take a break from something. Running that build script? Check Twitter.  Just got done editing a design document? Check Twitter. Get back from taking a walk? Check Twitter.

And my favorite: Nothing is interesting on Twitter right now.  I then close the tab.  I then without thinking open Twitter to see what's going on. Insanity.

So, I've decided to take a break from Twitter for the month of August.

I'm not really sure what I'm going to do with all of this free time.  I'll probably start writing (here) more. I also want to read some books, spend time with my wife, and start working through my PS4 game backlog (which is vast and shameful).

Speaking of this blog, I set up an IFTTT trigger to post new blog posts to my Twitter feed since I won't be on the site. That's not cheating is it?  It probably won't work anyways.

Can't wait to see what to be upset about in September. Yall take care!
